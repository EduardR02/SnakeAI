# SnakeAI
I programmed a Neural Network for the Snake game using a genetic algorithm and keras  
You will need keras backed by tf2 preferrably tf-gpu  
I used tkinter for the GUI which I probably shouldn't have done bet here we are  
Also you can run it without the GUI but i checked perfomance almost isn't affected unless maybe you run on CPU only idk  
You can save the models with "s", load them with "m", toggle listening for keys with "-" if you want to do something else while training,  
Control how many frames you skip in tkinter while simulating with "y" and "c" and control time per frame with "a", "d", "q" and "e"  
You can change these keys in key_control()
